>Préambule</span></b></a></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Les licences de la
plupart des logiciels sont conçues pour vous ôter toute liberté de les partager
et de les modifier. À l’opposé, les Licences Générales Publiques GNU ont pour
but de vous garantir votre liberté de partager et modifier un logiciel libre —
pour être sûr que le logiciel est bien libre pour tous les utilisateurs.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Cette licence, la
«&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique Limitée&nbsp;» (</span><i><span lang=EN
>“Lesser
General Public License”</span></i><span lang=FR 
>), s’applique à certains
paquets logiciels désignés spécifiquement&nbsp;—&nbsp;typiquement des
bibliothèques&nbsp;— de la </span><i><span lang=EN 
>Free Software Foundation</span></i><span
lang=FR 
> et d’autres auteurs qui décident de l’utiliser. Vous pouvez
l’utiliser aussi, mais nous vous suggérons de considérer d’abord si la présente
licence ou la «&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique GNU&nbsp;» (</span><i><span
lang=EN 
>“GNU General Public License”</span></i><span lang=FR
>)
ordinaire est la meilleure stratégie à utiliser dans chaque cas particulier,
suivant les explications données ci-dessous.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Quand nous parlons de
logiciel libre, nous parlons de la liberté de l’utiliser, pas de son prix. Nos
Licences Générales Publiques sont conçues pour s’assurer que vous disposerez de
la liberté de distribuer des copies du logiciel libre (et de facturer ce
service si vous le désirez)&nbsp;; que vous recevrez le code source ou pouvez
l’obtenir chaque fois que vous le souhaitez&nbsp;; que vous pouvez modifier le
logiciel et en utilisez tout ou partie dans de nouveaux programmes
libres&nbsp;; et que vous êtes informés que vous pouvez faire tout ceci.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Pour protéger vos
droits, nous devons émettre des restrictions qui interdisent aux distributeurs
de vous refuser ces droits ou de vous demander d’abandonner ces droits. Ces
restrictions se traduisent par certaines responsabilités pour vous si vous
distribuez des copies de la bibliothèque ou si vous la modifiez.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Par exemple, si vous
distribuez des copies de la bibliothèque, que ce soit à titre gratuit ou contre
un paiement, vous devez donner aux concessionnaires tous les droits que nous
vous avons concédés. Si vous liez d’autres codes avec la bibliothèque, vous
devez fournir des fichiers objets complets aux concessionnaires, de sorte
qu’ils peuvent les lier à nouveau avec la bibliothèque après l’avoir modifiée
et recompilée. Et vous devez leur montrer ces termes de sorte qu’ils puissent
connaître leurs droits.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Nous protégeons vos
droits par une méthode en deux étapes&nbsp;: (1) nous libellons la Bibliothèque
avec une notice de propriété intellectuelle (</span><i><span lang=EN
>“copyright”</span></i><span
lang=FR 
>) et (2) nous vous offrons cette Licence, qui vous donne le droit
de copier, distribuer ou modifier la bibliothèque.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Pour protéger chaque
distributeur, nous voulons établir de façon très claire qu’il n’y a aucune
garantie pour la Bibliothèque libre. Aussi, si la Bibliothèque est modifiée par
quelqu’un d’autre qui la redistribue ensuite, ses concessionnaires devraient
savoir que ce qu’ils ont n’est pas la version originale, de sorte que la
réputation de l’auteur original ne sera pas affectée à cause de problèmes
introduits par d’autres.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Enfin, les brevets
logiciels constituent une menace constante contre l’existence même de tout
logiciel libre. Nous voulons être sûr qu’une société ne peut pas effectivement
restreindre les utilisateurs d’un programme libre en obtenant une licence
restrictive d’un titulaire de brevet. Par conséquent, nous insistons pour que
toute licence de brevet obtenue pour une version de la Bibliothèque soit
cohérente avec sa pleine liberté d’utilisation spécifiée dans la présente
Licence.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>La plupart des logiciels
GNU, y compris certaines bibliothèques, sont couverts par la «&nbsp;Licence
Générale Publique GNU&nbsp;» (</span><i><span lang=EN 
>“GNU General Public License”</span></i><span
lang=FR 
>). La présente licence s’applique à certaines bibliothèques
désignées et est assez différente de la «&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique&nbsp;».
Nous utilisons la présente licence pour certaines bibliothèques afin de
permettre de lier ces bibliothèques, sous certaines conditions, à des
programmes non libres.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Quand un programme
est lié avec une bibliothèque, que ce soit statiquement ou avec une
bibliothèque partagée, la combinaison des deux constitue, en termes légaux, un
«&nbsp;travail combiné&nbsp;», un «&nbsp;dérivé&nbsp;» de la bibliothèque
originale. Il s’ensuit que la «&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique&nbsp;» ordinaire
ne permet une telle liaison que si l’entière combinaison remplie ses critères
et conditions de liberté. La «&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique Limitée&nbsp;»
permet de desserrer les critères permettant de lier d’autres codes avec la
bibliothèque.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Nous appelons cette
licence la Licence Générale Publique «&nbsp;Limitée&nbsp;» (</span><i><span
lang=EN 
>“Lesser” General Public License</span></i><span lang=FR
>)
car elle offre en fait une protection plus limitée de la liberté de
l’utilisateur que celle offerte par la «&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique&nbsp;»
ordinaire. Elle offre aux autres développeurs de logiciels libres un avantage
plus limité face aux programmes concurrents non libres. Ces désavantages sont
la raison pour laquelle nous utilisons la «&nbsp;Licence Générale
Publique&nbsp;» ordinaire pour de nombreuses bibliothèques. Cependant la
licence limitée offre des avantages dans certaines circonstances spéciales.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Par exemple, en de
rares occasions, il peut exister le besoin particulier d’encourager
l’utilisation la plus large possible d’une certaine bibliothèque, afin qu’elle
devienne un standard de facto. Pour arriver à cette fin, des programmes non
libres doivent pouvoir être autorisés à utiliser la bibliothèque. Un cas plus
fréquent est qu’une bibliothèque libre effectue les mêmes tâches que des
bibliothèques non libres largement utilisées. Dans ce cas, il n’y a pas grand
chose à gagner à limiter la bibliothèque libre aux seuls logiciels libres,
aussi nous utilisons la Licence Générale Publique Limitée.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Dans d’autres cas,
l’autorisation d’utiliser une bibliothèque particulière dans des programmes non
libres permet à un plus grand nombre de personnes d’utiliser un corpus très
large de logiciels libres. Par exemple, l’autorisation d’utiliser la
bibliothèque C GNU dans des programmes non libres permet à plus de personnes
d’utiliser le système d’exploitation GNU tout entier, de même que sa variante,
le système d’exploitation GNU/Linux.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Bien que la
«&nbsp;Licence Générale Publique Limitée&nbsp;» semble limiter la protection de
la liberté de l’utilisateur, elle assure que l’utilisateur d’un programme lié
avec la bibliothèque dispose de la liberté et du choix d’exécuter ce programme
en utilisant une version modifiée de la bibliothèque.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Les termes et
conditions précis concernant la copie, la distribution et la modification
suivent. Prenez une attention tout particulière aux différences entre un
«&nbsp;travail <b>basé</b> sur la Bibliothèque&nbsp;» et un «&nbsp;travail <b>utilisant</b>
la Bibliothèque&nbsp;». Le premier contient du code dérivé de la bibliothèque,
tandis que le second doit être combiné avec la bibliothèque afin de pouvoir
être exécuté.</span></p>

<p><a name=SEC3></a><a
href="http://org.rodage.com/lgpl.fr.html#TOC3"><b><span lang=FR
>TERMES
ET CONDITIONS CONCERNANT LA COPIE, LA DISTRIBUTION ET LA MODIFICATION</span></b></a></p>

<p><b><span lang=FR
>0.</span></b><span
lang=FR 
> Cet Accord de Licence s’applique à toute bibliothèque logicielle
ou tout programme contenant une notice placée par le titulaire de la
réservation de droits (</span><i><span lang=EN 
>“copyright”</span></i><span
lang=FR 
>) ou toute autre partie autorisée indiquant que ce logiciel peut
être distribué suivant les termes de cette Licence Générale Publique Limitée
(appelée ci-dessous «&nbsp;cette Licence&nbsp;»). Chacun des concessionnaires
de cette Licence sera désigné en tant que «&nbsp;Vous&nbsp;».</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Une
«&nbsp;bibliothèque&nbsp;» signifie une collection de fonctions logicielles ou
de données préparées de façon à être liée facilement à des programmes
applicatifs (utilisant tout ou partie de ces fonctions et données) afin de
former des exécutables.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>La «&nbsp;Bibliothèque&nbsp;»,
ci-dessous, se réfère à toute bibliothèque logicielle ou travail qui a été
distribué suivant ces termes. Un «&nbsp;travail basé sur la Bibliothèque&nbsp;»
signifie soit la Bibliothèque ou tout travail dérivé pouvant être soumis aux
lois de propriété intellectuelle&nbsp;: c’est-à-dire un travail contenant la
Bibliothèque ou une portion de celle-ci, soit en copie conforme, soit avec des
modification ou traduit directement dans une autre langue. (Dans la suite
ci-dessous, les traductions sont incluses sans limitation dans le terme
«&nbsp;modification&nbsp;».)</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Le «&nbsp;code
source&nbsp;» d’un travail signifie la forme préférée du travail permettant d’y
effectuer des modifications. Pour une bibliothèque, le code source complet
signifie tout le code source de tous les modules qu’elle contient, plus tous
les fichiers de définition d’interface associés, plus les scripts utilisés pour
contrôler la compilation et l’installation de la bibliothèque.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Les activités autres
que la copie, la distribution et la modification ne sont pas couvertes par
cette Licence&nbsp;; elles sont en dehors de son étendue. L’action d’exécuter
un programme utilisant la Bibliothèque n’est pas restreinte et les résultats
produits par un tel programme ne sont couverts que si leur contenu constitue un
travail basé sur la Bibliothèque (indépendamment de l’utilisation de la
Bibliothèque dans un outil utilisé pour l’écrire). Que ce soit ou non le cas
dépend de ce que réalise la Bibliothèque, et de ce que fait le programme
utilisant la Bibliothèque.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang=FR
>1.</span></b><span
lang=FR 
> Vous pouvez copier et distribuer des copies conformes du code
source complet de la Bibliothèque que vous recevez, sur tout support, pourvu
que vous publiiez scrupuleusement et de façon appropriée sur chaque copie la
notice de réservation de droit (</span><i><span lang=EN 
>“copyright”</span></i><span
lang=FR 
>) et un «&nbsp;déni de garantie&nbsp;»&nbsp;; gardez intactes
toutes les notices qui se réfèrent à cette Licence et à l’absence de toute
garantie&nbsp;; et distribuez une copie de cette Licence en même temps que la
Bibliothèque.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR font-size:
13.5pt;>Vous pouvez demander
un paiement pour l’action physique de transfert d’une copie et vous pouvez à
volonté offrir une protection de garantie en échange d’un paiement.</span></p>

<p>The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. <br>
  These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache<br>
  License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute<br>
  their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*<br>
  licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your<br>
  needs.
<p>To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear:<br>
  CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) <br>
  *or*<br>
  the Apache License, Version 2.0</p>
<p>However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL <br>
  license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing<br>
  of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both<br>
  for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the<br>
  GPL.</p>
<p>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only<br>
  question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute<br>
  modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different<br>
  ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license<br>
  used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or<br>
  added features.</p>

<p> The FreeType Project LICENSE<br>
  ----------------------------
<p> 2006-Jan-27</p>
<p> Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by<br>
  David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction<br>
  ============</p>
<p> The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;<br>
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
  various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the<br>
  FreeType Project.</p>
<p> This license applies to all files found in such packages, and<br>
  which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license<br>
  affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,<br>
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</p>
<p> This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG<br>
  (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion<br>
  and use of free software in commercial and freeware products<br>
  alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:</p>
<p> o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
  interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)</p>
<p> o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or<br>
  full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)</p>
<p> o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use<br>
  it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge<br>
  somewhere in your documentation that you have used the<br>
  FreeType code. (`credits')</p>
<p> We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this<br>
  software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.<br>
  We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and<br>
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
</p>
<p> Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a<br>
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus<br>
  encourage you to use the following text:</p>
<p> &quot;&quot;&quot;<br>
  Portions of this software are copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; The FreeType<br>
  Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.<br>
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p> Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you<br>
  actually use.<br>
</p>
<p>Legal Terms<br>
  ===========</p>
<p>0. Definitions<br>
  --------------</p>
<p> Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
  and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally<br>
  distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and<br>
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
  beta or final release.</p>
<p> `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where<br>
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
  code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.<br>
  This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType<br>
  engine'.</p>
<p> This license applies to all files distributed in the original<br>
  FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and<br>
  documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its<br>
  original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.<br>
  If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by<br>
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>
<p> The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner,<br>
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as<br>
  specified below.</p>
<p>1. No Warranty<br>
  --------------</p>
<p> THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br>
  BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO<br>
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</p>
<p>2. Redistribution<br>
  -----------------</p>
<p> This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and<br>
  irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,<br>
  display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and<br>
  sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code<br>
  forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to<br>
  authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted<br>
  herein, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p> o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file<br>
  (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to<br>
  the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying<br>
  documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered,<br>
  original files must be preserved in all copies of source<br>
  files.</p>
<p> o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that<br>
  states that the software is based in part of the work of the<br>
  FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also<br>
  encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your<br>
  documentation, though this isn't mandatory.</p>
<p> These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on<br>
  the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use<br>
  our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid<br>
  to us.</p>
<p>3. Advertising<br>
  --------------</p>
<p> Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use<br>
  the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>
  purposes without specific prior written permission.</p>
<p> We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the<br>
  following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation<br>
  or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',<br>
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.</p>
<p> As you have not signed this license, you are not required to<br>
  accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted<br>
  material, only this license, or another one contracted with the<br>
  authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.<br>
  Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType<br>
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
  of this license.</p>
<p>4. Contacts<br>

  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  Version 2, June 1991
<p> Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor<br>
  Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is<br>
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</p>
<p> Preamble</p>
<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p> This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for<br>
  your libraries, too.</p>
<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</p>
<p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
  you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p> Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p> Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
  library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
  the original authors' reputations.</p>
<p> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
  transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,<br>
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
  free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This<br>
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
  designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
  the same as in the ordinary license.</p>
<p> The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
  program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without<br>
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
  analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in<br>
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
  treats it as such.</p>
<p> Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We<br>
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</p>
<p> However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
  libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
  libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this<br>
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.</p>
<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The<br>
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
  works together with the library.</p>
<p> Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
  General Public License rather than by this special one.</p>
<p> GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
  General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is<br>
  addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p> A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p> The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
  which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>
  Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>
<p> &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
  and installation of the library.</p>
<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
  and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
  Library.</p>
<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
  fee.</p>
<p> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
  in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
  its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
  root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
  it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
  these notices.</p>
<p> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
  the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<p> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
  linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a<br>
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p> However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>
  library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p> When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
  work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
<p> 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
  link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br>
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
  this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
  of these things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br>
  uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
  to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p> b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
  least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
  than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
<p> c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
  specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p> d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p> For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>
  Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
  reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
  the executable.</p>
<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
  distribute.</p>
<p> 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
  Sections above.</p>
<p> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
  this License.</p>
<p> 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
  excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
  written in the body of this License.</p>
<p> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p> 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
  and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
  DAMAGES.</p>
<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
  ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br>
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p> &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p> This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
  Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
<p> You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<br>
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p>
<p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>

<p>LEGAL ISSUES<br>
  ============
<p>In plain English:</p>
<p>1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs,<br>
  please let us know!)<br>
  2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.<br>
  3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a<br>
  program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that<br>
  you've used the IJG code.</p>
<p>In legalese:</p>
<p>The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,<br>
  with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or<br>
  fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;, and you,<br>
  its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.</p>
<p>This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.<br>
  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.</p>
<p>Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this<br>
  software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these<br>
  conditions:<br>
  (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this<br>
  README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice<br>
  unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files<br>
  must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.<br>
  (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying<br>
  documentation must state that &quot;this software is based in part on the work of<br>
  the Independent JPEG Group&quot;.<br>
  (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts<br>
  full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept<br>
  NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.</p>
<p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,<br>
  not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to<br>
  acknowledge us.</p>
<p>Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name<br>
  in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from<br>
  it. This software may be referred to only as &quot;the Independent JPEG Group's<br>
  software&quot;.</p>
<p>We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of<br>
  commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are<br>
  assumed by the product vendor.<br>
</p>
<p>ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,<br>
  sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.<br>
  ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead<br>
  by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,<br>
  that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file<br>
  ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<br>
  of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<br>
  the foregoing paragraphs do.</p>
<p>The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.<br>
  It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<br>
  The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<br>
  ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright<br>
  by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</p>
<p>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by<br>
  patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot<br>
  legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,<br>
  support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.<br>
  (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented<br>
  Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)<br>
  So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining<br>
  code.</p>
<p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br>
  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<br>
  been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<br>
&quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;. This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<br>
  resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<br>
  GIF decoders.</p>
<p>We are required to state that<br>
&quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<br>
  CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of<br>
  CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;</p>

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  Version 2.1, February 1999
<p> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
  the version number 2.1.]</p>
<p> Preamble</p>
<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br>
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations<br>
  below.</p>
<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
  these things.</p>
<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
  you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br>
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
  introduced by others.<br>
   <br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
  any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
  restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br>
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br>
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
  libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<p> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
  combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br>
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br>
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
  the library.</p>
<p> We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<br>
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
  Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br>
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
  libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
  special circumstances.</p>
<p> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it<br>
  becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must<br>
  be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br>
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br>
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
  free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
  system.</p>
<p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
  that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The<br>
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
  be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
   <br>
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
  this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br>
  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p> A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p> The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
  which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>
  Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>
<p> &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control<br>
  compilation and installation of the library.</p>
<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
  and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
<p> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
  Library.</p>
<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
  fee.<br>
   <br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
  in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
  its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
  root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
  it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
  these notices.<br>
   <br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
  the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<p> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
  linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a<br>
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p> However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>
  library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p> When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
  work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
   <br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
  link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br>
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
  this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
  of these things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br>
  uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
  to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p> b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
<p> c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least<br>
  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in<br>
  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of<br>
  performing this distribution.</p>
<p> d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
  specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p> e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p> For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>
  Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
  reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
  the executable.</p>
<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
  distribute.<br>
   <br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
  Sections above.</p>
<p> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
  this License.<br>
   <br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
  circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License<br>
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those<br>
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.<br>
   <br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
  and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
  DAMAGES.</p>
<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
   <br>
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms<br>
  of the ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.<br>
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most<br>
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should<br>
  have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full<br>
  notice is found.<br>
</p>
<p> &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p> This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
  Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
<p> You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or<br>
  your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,<br>
  if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James<br>
  Random Hacker.</p>
<p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>

  Version 2.1, February 1999</p>
<p> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
  the version number 2.1.]</p>
<p> Preamble</p>
<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br>
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
  these things.</p>
<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
  you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br>
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
  introduced by others.<br>
   <br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
  any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
  restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br>
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br>
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
  libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<p> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
  combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br>
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br>
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
  the library.</p>
<p> We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<br>
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
  Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br>
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
  libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
  special circumstances.</p>
<p> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
  a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
  allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br>
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br>
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
  free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
  system.</p>
<p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
  that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The<br>
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
  be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
   <br>
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
  this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br>
  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p> A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p> The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
  which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>
  Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>
<p> &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
  and installation of the library.</p>
<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
  and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
  Library.</p>
<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
  fee.<br>
   <br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
  in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
  its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
  root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
  it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
  these notices.<br>
   <br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
  the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<p> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
  linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a<br>
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p> However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>
  library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p> When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
  work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
   <br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
  link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br>
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
  this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
  of these things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br>
  uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
  to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p> b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
<p> c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
  least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
  than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
<p> d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
  specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p> e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p> For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>
  Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
  reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
  the executable.</p>
<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
  distribute.<br>
   <br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
  Sections above.</p>
<p> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
  this License.<br>
   <br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
  excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
  written in the body of this License.</p>
<p> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.<br>
   <br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
  and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
  DAMAGES.</p>
<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
   <br>
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
  ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br>
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p> &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p> This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
  Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
<p> You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<br>
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p>
<p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
<p>That's all there is to it!</p>

<p> GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  Version 2, June 1991
<p> Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is<br>
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</p>
<p> Preamble</p>
<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p> This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for<br>
  your libraries, too.</p>
<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</p>
<p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
  you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p> Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p> Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
  library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
  the original authors' reputations.<br>
   <br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
  transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,<br>
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
  free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This<br>
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
  designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
  the same as in the ordinary license.</p>
<p> The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
  program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without<br>
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
  analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in<br>
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
  treats it as such.</p>
<p> Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We<br>
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</p>
<p> However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
  libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
  libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this<br>
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.</p>
<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The<br>
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
  works together with the library.</p>
<p> Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
  General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
   <br>
  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
  General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is<br>
  addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p> A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p> The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
  which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>
  Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>
<p> &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
  and installation of the library.</p>
<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
  and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
  Library.</p>
<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
  fee.<br>
   <br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
  in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
  its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
  root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
  it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
  these notices.<br>
   <br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
  the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<p> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
  linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a<br>
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p> However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>
  library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p> When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
  work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
   <br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
  link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br>
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
  this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
  of these things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br>
  uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
  to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p> b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
  least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
  than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
<p> c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
  specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p> d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p> For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>
  Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
  reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
  the executable.</p>
<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
  distribute.<br>
   <br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
  Sections above.</p>
<p> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
  this License.<br>
   <br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
  excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
  written in the body of this License.</p>
<p> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.<br>
   <br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
  and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
  DAMAGES.</p>
<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
   <br>
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
  ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br>
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p> &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p> This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
  Library General Public License for more details.</p>
<p> You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<br>
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p>
<p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>

<p> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  Version 2.1, February 1999
<p> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
  the version number 2.1.]</p>
<p> Preamble</p>
<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br>
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
  these things.</p>
<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
  you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br>
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
  introduced by others.<br>
   <br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
  any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
  restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br>
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br>
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
  libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<p> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
  combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br>
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br>
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
  the library.</p>
<p> We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<br>
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
  Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br>
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
  libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
  special circumstances.</p>
<p> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
  a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
  allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br>
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br>
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
  free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
  system.</p>
<p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
  that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The<br>
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
  be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
   <br>
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
  this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br>
  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p> A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p> The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
  which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>
  Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>
<p> &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
  and installation of the library.</p>
<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
  and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
  Library.</p>
<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
  fee.<br>
   <br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
  in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
  its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
  root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
  it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
  these notices.<br>
   <br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
  the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<p> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
  linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a<br>
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p> However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>
  library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p> When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
  work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
   <br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
  link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br>
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
  this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
  of these things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br>
  uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
  to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p> b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
<p> c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
  least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
  than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
<p> d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
  specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p> e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p> For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>
  Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
  reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
  the executable.</p>
<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
  distribute.<br>
   <br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
  Sections above.</p>
<p> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
  this License.<br>
   <br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
  excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
  written in the body of this License.</p>
<p> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.<br>
   <br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
  and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
  DAMAGES.</p>
<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
   <br>
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
  ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br>
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p> &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p> This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
  Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
<p> You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<br>
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p>
<p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
<p>That's all there is to it!</p>
